   Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve. It is a leading cause of blindness in the United States. It usually happens when the fluid pressure inside the eyes slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Often there are no symptoms at first. Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains.    A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. People at risk should get eye exams at least every two years. They include       -  African Americans over age 40    -  People over age 60, especially Mexican Americans    -  People with a family history of glaucoma       There is no cure, but glaucoma can usually be controlled. Early treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. Treatments usually include prescription eyedrops and/or surgery.    NIH: National Eye Institute Glaucoma is a group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision loss and blindness. The most common form of the disease is open-angle glaucoma. With early treatment, you can often protect your eyes against serious vision loss. (Watch the video to learn more about glaucoma.

It connects the retina to the brain. Open-angle glaucoma is the most common form of glaucoma. In the normal eye, the clear fluid leaves the anterior chamber at the open angle where the cornea and iris meet. When the fluid reaches the angle, it flows through a spongy meshwork, like a drain, and leaves the eye. Sometimes, when the fluid reaches the angle, it passes too slowly through the meshwork drain, causing the pressure inside the eye to build. If the pressure damages the optic nerve, open-angle glaucoma -- and vision loss -- may result.\nName: answer, dtype: object"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.options.display.max_colwidth = 50\ntrain_df, test_df = train_test_split(aggregated_answers, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\ntrain_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-21T14:13:30.096528Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-21T14:13:30.096892Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-21T14:13:30.114248Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-21T14:13:30.096865Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-21T14:13:30.113348Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"execution_count":5,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                                question  \\\n1572   How to diagnose Dermatitis Herpetiformis: Skin...   \n12976                          What is (are) Tularemia ?   \n879    How many people are affected by congenital hyp...   \n1578               How to diagnose Diabetic mastopathy ?   \n13502                 What is (are) hypochondrogenesis ?   \n...                                                  ...   \n5191   What are the symptoms of Cataract, total conge...   \n13418  What is (are) fragile X-associated primary ova...   \n5390   What are the symptoms of Corneal dystrophy Thi...   \n860    How many people are affected by common variabl...   \n7270    What are the symptoms of Tracheobronchomalacia ?   \n\n                                                  answer  \n1572   A skin biopsy is the first step in diagnosing ...  \n12976  Tularemia is an infection common in wild roden...  \n879    Congenital hyperinsulinism affects approximate...  \n1578   How is diabetic mastopathy diagnosed?
